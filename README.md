# 2019RecyclerViewParallax
I created this project to set things with recycler view and parallaxing effects on image views right in 2019. Taking inspiration from old libraries/projects addressing this design request:

https://github.com/bopbi/RecyclerParallax
https://github.com/Narfss/ParallaxEverywhere
https://github.com/yayaa/ParallaxRecyclerView

But making everything much cleaner, simpler, behind the scenes, and working in all possible scenarios. 
Classes written in Kotlin, using AndroidX libraries (should still work with old ones tho, just change ImageView & RecyclerView imports), using LayoutContainer, kotlin synthetics and better abstraction and separation of concerns.

If you have any concerns email me on: kinzlstanislav@gmail.com
